Add the certificate in the certificate store or the keychain.

The certificate argument will use the friendly name to find the certificate in the store.

Two optional parameters can be used to specify the store name and the store location.

    -n | --storename => The name of the folder where the certificate is stored in a Keychain or Certificate Store.
                        Default is My!      

    -l | --storelocation => The location where the certificate is stored in a Keychain or Certificate Store.
                            Like on Windows: CurrentUser or LocalMachine.
                            Default is CurrentUser!

You can decrypt a text or a file by using the following commands:
    text => The text to decrypt
    file => The file to decrypt

Example:

    arc4u.cyphertool decrypt from certificatestore "encryptor" text "My text to decrypt"
    arc4u.cyphertool decrypt from certificatestore "encryptor" file "My file to decrypt"

    arc4u.cyphertool decrypt from certificatestore "encryptor" -n "My" -l "LocalMachine" text "My text to decrypt"
    arc4u.cyphertool decrypt from certificatestore "encryptor" -n "My" -l "LocalMachine" file "My file to decrypt"
