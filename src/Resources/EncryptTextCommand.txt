|       Arc4u Cyphertool.        |
----------------------------------

When you use the cypher tool and you want to encrypt a text based on a certificate,
you have to provide the clear text via the text argument like this:

As the text to encrypt can contain a $0 by example, you have to use the single quote to specify the text to encrypt.
Otherwise the $0 will be the end of the text to encrypt.

                               / pfx "C:\temp\devCert.pfx" -p password \ 
arc4u.cyphertool encrypt with |                                         | text 'clear text' -o "file"
                               \ cert "devCert" -l LocalMachine -n My  / 

Optionnaly you can specify that the encrypted text must be saved in a file.
-o | --output => The file to store the content.

=>    arc4u.cyphertool encrypt with certificate-store "certificate" ... text "encrypt me"  (-o | --output "file")
