----------------------------------

Decrypt from a pfx file.


                                                                     / text "clear text" \
arc4u.cyphertool decrypt with pfx "C:\temp\devCert.pfx" -p password |                     | -o "file"
                                                                     \ file "path"       /


Optionnaly you can add the password to the pfx file.
-p | --password => The password to use for the file pfx certificate

If the password is not set, a prompt will be displayed to ask for the password.

You can decrypt a text or a file by adding the following commands:
    text => The text to decrypt
    file => The file to decrypt

Example:

arc4u.cyphertool decrypt with pfx /path/to/certificate.pfx -p password text "cypher text"
arc4u.cyphertool decrypt with pfx /path/to/certificate.pfx -p password file "the path to the file to decrypt."

arc4u.cyphertool decrypt with pfx /path/to/certificate.pfx text "cypher text"
arc4u.cyphertool decrypt with pfx /path/to/certificate.pfx file "the path to the file to decrypt."
