Encrypt from a pfx file.

As the text to encrypt can contain a $0 by example, you have to use the single quote to specify the text to encrypt.
Otherwise the $0 will be the end of the text to encrypt.

                                                                     / text 'clear text' \
arc4u.cyphertool encrypt with pfx "C:\temp\devCert.pfx" -p password |                     | -o "file"
                                                                     \ file "path"       /


Optionnaly you can add the password to the pfx file.
-p | --password => The password to use for the file pfx certificate

If the password is not set, a prompt will be displayed to ask for the password.

You can encrypt a text or a file by adding the following commands:
    text => The text to encrypt
    file => The file to encrypt

Example:

arc4u.cyphertool encrypt with pfx /path/to/certificate.pfx -p password text "cypher text"
arc4u.cyphertool encrypt with pfx /path/to/certificate.pfx -p password file "the path to the file to encrypt."

arc4u.cyphertool encrypt with pfx /path/to/certificate.pfx text "cypher text"
arc4u.cyphertool encrypt with pfx /path/to/certificate.pfx file "the path to the file to encrypt."
