|       Arc4u Cyphertool.        |
----------------------------------

Let you encrypt a text or a file using a certificate or a pfx file.

With a certificate in the certificate store or keychain.
arc4u.cyphertool encrypt with certificate-store "certifcate friendly name" text "clear text"

As the text to encrypt can contain a $0 by example, you have to use the single quote to specify the text to encrypt.
Otherwise the $0 will be the end of the text to encrypt.


                               / pfx "C:\temp\devCert.pfx" -p password \ / text 'clear text' \
arc4u.cyphertool encrypt with |                                         |                     | -o "file"
                               \ cert "devCert" -l LocalMachine -n My  / \ file "path"       /



With a pfx file.
    -p | --password is not given, a prompt will ask the password.

With a certificate from the store or the keychain.
    The search is only based on the friendly name.

    -n | --store-name     : The name of the folder where the certificate is stored in a Keychain or Certificate Store.
    -l | --store-location : The location where the certificate is stored in a Keychain or Certificate Store.
                            Like on Windows: CurrentUser or LocalMachine.
                            Default is CurrentUser!

text or file sub-command:
- text => The text to encrypt.
- file => The file to encrypt.

If no -o | --output option is given the content will be written to the console.
