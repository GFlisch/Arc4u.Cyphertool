Encrypt with a certificate in the certificate store or the keychain searching based on the friendly name to find the certificate in the store.


                                                                    / text "clear text" \
arc4u.cyphertool encrypt from cert "devCert" -l LocalMachine -n My |                     | -o "file"
                                                                    \ file "path"       /



Two optional parameters can be used to specify the store name and the store location.

    -n | --storename => The name of the folder where the certificate is stored in a Keychain or Certificate Store.
                        Default is My!      

    -l | --storelocation => The location where the certificate is stored in a Keychain or Certificate Store.
                            Like on Windows: CurrentUser or LocalMachine.
                            Default is CurrentUser!

You can encrypt a text or a file by adding the following commands:
    text => The text to encrypt
    file => The file to encrypt


Example:

    arc4u.cyphertool encrypt from certificatestore "encryptor" text "text to encrypt"
    arc4u.cyphertool encrypt from certificatestore "encryptor" file "file to encrypt"

    arc4u.cyphertool encrypt from certificatestore "encryptor" -n "My" -l "LocalMachine" text "text to encrypt"
    arc4u.cyphertool encrypt from certificatestore "encryptor" -n "My" -l "LocalMachine" file "file to encrypt"
